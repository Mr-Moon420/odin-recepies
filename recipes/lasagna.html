    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagne are a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, oregano and basil. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically cooked pasta is assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>
    
    <p>Lasagne originated in Italy during the Middle Ages. The oldest transcribed text about lasagne appears in 1282 in the Memoriali Bolognesi ("Bolognesi Memorials"), in which lasagne was mentioned in a poem transcribed by a Bolognese notary; while the first recorded recipe was set down in the early 14th-century Liber de Coquina (The Book of Cookery). It bore only a slight resemblance to the later traditional form of lasagne, featuring a fermented dough flattened into thin sheets (lasagne), boiled, sprinkled with cheese and spices, and then eaten with a small pointed stick. Recipes written in the century following the Liber de Coquina recommended boiling the pasta in chicken broth and dressing it with cheese and chicken fat. In a recipe adapted for the Lenten fast, walnuts were recommended.</p>

        <li>2 (26 ounce) jars pasta sauce</li>
            
        <li> 1 teaspoon dried basil</li>

        <li>1 (15 ounce) container part-skim ricotta cheese</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes, or until al dente. Rinse with cold water, and drain.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan. Cook and stir together mushrooms, green peppers, onion, and garlic until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in pasta sauce and basil; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, mix together ricotta, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and eggs in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup cooked tomato and vegetable sauce into the bottom of a greased 9x13-inch baking dish.
