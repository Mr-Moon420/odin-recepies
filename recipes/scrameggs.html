    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Scrambled eggs are a dish made from eggs (usually chicken eggs) stirred, whipped or beaten together while being gently heated, typically with salt, butter, oil and sometimes other ingredients</p>
    
    <p>Only eggs are necessary to make scrambled eggs,but salt, water, milk, chives, cream, crème fraîche, sour cream, or grated cheese may be added. The eggs are cracked into a bowl with some salt and pepper, and the mixture is stirred or whisked: alternatively, the eggs are cracked directly into a hot pan or skillet, and the whites and yolks stirred together as they cook. Recipes disagree on whether milk, cream, or water should be added.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sliced Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 thin slices ham (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs together in a small bowl until smooth. Mix in Cheddar cheese, ham, and heavy cream.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Pour in egg mixture; cook and stir until set but still moist, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
